# 🧃 NFT Liquidator — Swap Solana NFTs to Any SPL Token Instantly

A seamless way to **sell your NFTs** and receive **any SPL token (like USDC or USDT)** in return — powered by Solana, Tensor, and Jupiter Aggregator.

## 🚨 Problem

Solana NFTs are usually denominated in **SOL**, but most users — especially traders and collectors — prefer stablecoins like **USDC/USDT** for simplicity and liquidity.

Currently, there's **no easy way** to sell an NFT and instantly receive your preferred token. You have to:

- Manually list the NFT
- Wait for a buyer
- Then manually swap the received SOL for another token

This is time-consuming and risky.
